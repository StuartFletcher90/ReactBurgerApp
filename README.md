# ReactBurgerApp

My react burger app is a full stack project I've been working on during my time at CodeNation on the second cohort.

It compromised of React, node, axios, react router, firebase & firestore.

I'm really happy with this project, This was done following a udemy tutorial with an assigned end goal of having a fully functional burger app containing many working components.

Working with firebase to use it to store individual orders with unique ids. Using it as a database was an incredible learning experience, gaining a lot of knowledge of debugging and working on my own in resolving issues with firebase & firestore, with help from resources like documentation, stackoverflow & trial and error.
